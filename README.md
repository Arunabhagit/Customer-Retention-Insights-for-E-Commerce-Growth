#  E-Commerce Retention Campaign Analysis

# Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing the performance of an **E-Commerce 75% discount On First Purchase campaign launched on April 1st, 2025**, targeting loyal customers. The campaign aimed to boost customer engagement and repeat purchases through a strategic loyalty discount offer. The marketing team sought to evaluate the campaign's effectiveness by examining key performance indicators such as conversion rate, customer response, revenue impact, and engagement across different regions and customer segments.
To fulfill this objective, a comprehensive data analysis was conducted using **Power BI**. The analysis includes metrics such as total campaign reach, response rate, post-campaign revenue, and segment-wise performance breakdowns. The insights derived from this analysis are intended to inform future marketing strategies and help optimize campaign targeting for improved business outcomes.

# Data Used 

For this analysis, two structured datasets were used:

**April 2025 Campaign Data**: This dataset contains campaign interaction and response data for 800 customers who were part of the loyalty discount offer launched in April 2025. It includes variables such as campaign reach, customer response, revenue generated, and customer attributes across different regions.

**June 2024 Campaign Data**: This dataset similarly contains information for 800 customers from an earlier loyalty campaign conducted in June 2024. It serves as a benchmark for comparing customer behavior, conversion patterns, and segment-wise engagement over time.

Both datasets represent **clustered samples of 800 customers each**, drawn from a significantly larger customer population. They provide a basis for evaluating the performance and impact of loyalty campaigns across different time periods.

# Objectives 

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the effectiveness of the April 2025 customer retention campaign aimed at re-engaging inactive customers through targeted loyalty offers. Key goals include identifying the targeted customer group, calculating the campaign's conversion rate, and measuring changes in customer behavior post-campaign. The project also evaluates revenue impact, customer segmentation performance, compareing with last year campaign. Additionally, it aims to uncover which marketing channels and customer segments responded best, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize future campaigns and improve long-term customer retention.

# Insights Got From 2025 April Customer Retention Campaign 

After receiving the mail from the Marketing Lead, I created a Power BI dashboard to analyze the April 2025 campaign data. Based on this analysis, I generated key insights and answered specific business questions posed by the Marketing Lead to evaluate the campaign's effectiveness.

This upward trend highlights the growing impact of our campaigns and reflects stronger customer loyalty and improved marketing effectiveness year over year.

Compared to last year’s campaign, we sent **5%** more offers this year. On the positive side, customer purchases increased by **21%**, indicating stronger engagement. Additionally, the number of customers who did not make a purchase decreased by **25%**, reflecting a significant improvement in campaign effectiveness and customer response.

The conversion rate—representing the percentage of customers who made a purchase after receiving the offer—increased by **11%** compared to last year. Furthermore, post-campaign revenue saw a remarkable **50%** growth, highlighting a significant improvement in both customer response and overall campaign success year over year.

Compared to last year, the number of active users has increased by approximately **20%**. In the 2024 campaign, inactive users slightly outnumbered active ones, indicating weaker retention. However, this year’s campaign led to a significant improvement, with **68%** of users remaining active post-campaign, demonstrating a much stronger customer retention outcome.

We observed a significant shift in purchasing behavior between product categories. In the 2024 campaign, customers primarily purchased **home décor** items during the offer period. However, in 2025, **groceries** became the top-selling category. This change is likely influenced by seasonal demand and the **rising prices** of essential goods, driving more practical purchases.

In the 2025 campaign, a new feature—**App Notifications**—was introduced to deliver the offer directly to customers, which proved to be highly effective and well-received. In contrast, the 2024 campaign saw **Loyalty Offers** as the most utilized method among frequent customers. Additionally, both years included **SMS** and **Email** communications to promote the campaign and ensure wider reach.

The revenue generated after the campaign significantly increased this year compared to last year. In both years, customers from the **North** region made the highest number of purchases, contributing the most to overall revenue.
