# LoyaltyLens: E-Commerce Retention Campaign Analysis

# Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing the performance of an **E-Commerce 50% discount campaign launched on April 1st, 2025**, targeting loyal customers. The campaign aimed to boost customer engagement and repeat purchases through a strategic loyalty discount offer. The marketing team sought to evaluate the campaign's effectiveness by examining key performance indicators such as conversion rate, customer response, revenue impact, and engagement across different regions and customer segments.
To fulfill this objective, a comprehensive data analysis was conducted using Power BI. The analysis includes metrics such as total campaign reach, response rate, post-campaign revenue, and segment-wise performance breakdowns. The insights derived from this analysis are intended to inform future marketing strategies and help optimize campaign targeting for improved business outcomes.

# Data Used 

For this analysis, two structured datasets were used:

**April 2025 Campaign Data**: This dataset contains campaign interaction and response data for 800 customers who were part of the loyalty discount offer launched in April 2025. It includes variables such as campaign reach, customer response, revenue generated, and customer attributes across different regions.

**June 2024 Campaign Data**: This dataset similarly contains information for 800 customers from an earlier loyalty campaign conducted in June 2024. It serves as a benchmark for comparing customer behavior, conversion patterns, and segment-wise engagement over time.

Both datasets represent clustered samples of 800 customers each, drawn from a significantly larger customer population. They provide a basis for evaluating the performance and impact of loyalty campaigns across different time periods.

# Objectives 

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the effectiveness of the April 2025 customer retention campaign aimed at re-engaging inactive customers through targeted loyalty offers. Key goals include identifying the targeted customer group, calculating the campaign's conversion rate, and measuring changes in customer behavior post-campaign. The project also evaluates revenue impact, customer segmentation performance, compareing with last year campaign. Additionally, it aims to uncover which marketing channels and customer segments responded best, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize future campaigns and improve long-term customer retention.
