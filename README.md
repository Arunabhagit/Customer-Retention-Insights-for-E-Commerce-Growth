#  E-Commerce Customer Retention Campaign Analysis

# Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing the performance of an **E-Commerce 75% discount On First Purchase campaign launched on April 1st, 2025**, targeting loyal customers. The campaign aimed to boost customer engagement and repeat purchases through a strategic loyalty discount offer. The marketing team sought to evaluate the campaign's effectiveness by examining key performance indicators such as conversion rate, customer response, revenue impact, and engagement across different regions and customer segments.
To fulfill this objective, a comprehensive data analysis was conducted using **Power BI**. The analysis includes metrics such as total campaign reach, response rate, post-campaign revenue, and segment-wise performance breakdowns. The insights derived from this analysis are intended to inform future marketing strategies and help optimize campaign targeting for improved business outcomes.

# Data Used 

For this analysis, two structured datasets were used:

**April 2025 Campaign Data**: This dataset contains campaign interaction and response data for 800 customers who were part of the loyalty discount offer launched in April 2025. It includes variables such as campaign reach, customer response, revenue generated, and customer attributes across different regions.

**June 2024 Campaign Data**: This dataset similarly contains information for 800 customers from an earlier loyalty campaign conducted in June 2024. It serves as a benchmark for comparing customer behavior, conversion patterns, and segment-wise engagement over time.

Both datasets represent **clustered samples of 800 customers each**, drawn from a significantly larger customer population. They provide a basis for evaluating the performance and impact of loyalty campaigns across different time periods.

# Objectives 

This project analyzes the effectiveness of the April 2025 customer retention campaign designed to re-engage inactive customers through targeted loyalty offers. It focuses on identifying the targeted customer group, calculating the campaign’s conversion rate, and evaluating changes in customer behavior post-campaign. Key metrics include revenue impact, performance of customer segmentation, and a comparison with last year’s campaign results. The analysis also explores which marketing channels and customer segments delivered the best responses. Insights from this project will support data-driven decisions to optimize future campaigns and enhance long-term customer retention strategies for improved business performance.

# Analysis and Decisions : 

After receiving the request from the Marketing Lead, I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze the April 2025 customer retention campaign. The data shows that out of **800** customers, **659** received the offer and 522 made a purchase, resulting in a strong conversion rate of **79.2%**, indicating high engagement and campaign effectiveness. Additionally, **68%** of customers remained active post-campaign, demonstrating a strong retention impact.

Revenue analysis revealed the Groceries category as the top performer, followed by Electronics and Beauty. Active users contributed most of the revenue, though inactive users also engaged across several categories. Among campaign channels, App Notifications performed best, especially for Groceries, while SMS Reminders, Emails, and Loyalty Offers showed solid performance.

Regional analysis showed the West had the highest conversion rate, while the East responded fastest. Year-over-year comparison with June 2024 revealed significant improvements in engagement, revenue, and customer retention—confirming the campaign's overall success.
